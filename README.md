Subprograms table generator
--------------------
This is a real revolution in the world of writing reports!

Tired of manually filling the table with subroutines, spending a huge amount of time on this? Do you just just fill in the description, and then, not even everywhere? This program is exactly for you!

It compiles a table of subroutines and its parameters according to your code. Sounds like a fairy tale? And here not!

In addition, the program generates a description for subroutines and parameters, the purpose of which our AI can guess!

And you can do code self-documentation. Leave comments before the procedure and it will be used as a description in the table! Conveniently ?! Madly, and plus everything makes your mind clearer and more beautiful!

How to use
--------------------
+ Paste your code into the text box on the left. 
+ Then click "Convert". 
+ Make sure the data in the table is correct. 
+ Click the "To Word" button and select in the dialog box where to save the file.
+ Done! Now fill in the missing information and insert the table into your report!
