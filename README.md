Subprograms table generator
--------------------
This is a real revolution in the world of writing reports!

Tired of manually filling the table with subprograms, spending a huge amount of time on this? You want only to fill in the description? This program is exactly for you!

It compiles a table of subprograms and its parameters according to your code. Sounds like a fairy tale? And here not!

In addition, the program generates a description for subprograms and parameters, the purpose of which our AI can guess!

And you can do code self-documentation. Leave comments before the procedure and it will be used as a description in the table! Conveniently ?! Madly, and plus everything makes your mind clearer and more beautiful!
